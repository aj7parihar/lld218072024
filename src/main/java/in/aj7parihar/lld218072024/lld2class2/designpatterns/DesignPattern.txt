## Design Patterns -

Design Patterns - Set of solutions to most commonly occurring problems
while designing and building s/w systems.

Word "Design Patterns" came from "Gangs of Four (GoF) Design Patterns" who are authors of the book
"Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software"

# GoF Design Pattern Types -

GoF Design Patterns are divided into three categories on the basis of class or object:

1. Creational: The design patterns that deal with the creation of an object.

2. Structural: The design patterns in this category deals with the class structure,
such as Inheritance and Composition.

3. Behavioral: This type of design patterns provide solution for the better interaction between objects,
how to provide lose coupling, and flexibility to extend easily in the future.
