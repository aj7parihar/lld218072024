Factory Design Pattern aka Factory Method Design Pattern
--> This design pattern is used when we have one super class with multiple sub-classes and
based on input, we need to return one of the sub-class.
--> This pattern takes out the responsibility of the instantiation of a class from the Client program
to the Factory class.

--> Super class in Factory Design Pattern can either be an Interface, Abstract class or a normal Java class.
