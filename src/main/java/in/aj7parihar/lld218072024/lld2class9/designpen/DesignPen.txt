# Design a PEN

1. Overview
    - Know - No
    - Don't know - Yes, could you please provide a brief overview, after this listen to what interviewer says.
        - ask question only when interviewer is done.

        - Overview given by Karan:
            Do an entity design (class diagram) to represents a s/w system that supports
            add, delete, etc. (here it is asking CRUD operations) of multiple types of Pen.

2. What kind of systems do I need to build?
    - What design?
        Since it is clearly mentioned in the overview that we need to design only class diagram hence
        Schema Design and E2E coding not required.

    - What user interactions required, REST API or Command Line?
        Clearly asked only for Class Diagram hence this not required.

    - Data Persistence required?
        Clearly asked only for Class Diagram hence this is also not required.

3. Requirement gathering
    - >=5 features/use cases (MVP)
    - if there is time then >=2 good to have features
    - keep asking questions

    -> Requirement gathering for Pen Design
        - What is a Pen? - Physical entity that writes on paper (except pencil)
        - Types of Pen - ball, gel, fountain/ink, etc.
        - Does it have refill? - ball and gel has refill, fountain or ink does not have
        - Is it refillable? - some pens are but some are use and throw
        - Refill will have nib
        - Ink pen has nib directly
        - Refill will have ink, but fountain pen will have ink directly
        - Variety of pen - single refill or multiple refill
        - Colors? - red, blue, black, etc.
        - Nib can be of different radius

4. Class Diagram -
    - Visualization
        - Physical Structure
        - User Journey

    - refer "PenEntityDesign.mmd"


5. Schema Design - not required, cleared in step 2
